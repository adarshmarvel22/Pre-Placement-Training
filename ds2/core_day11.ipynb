        "\n",
        "Word embeddings are a type of word representation that captures the semantic meaning of words. They are typically learned from a large corpus of text, and they represent each word as a vector of real numbers. The values in the vector represent the word's meaning in relation to other words in the corpus. For example, the word \"cat\" might have a vector that is close to the vector for the word \"dog\", because these words are semantically related.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embeddings can be used to improve the performance of text processing tasks by providing a more meaningful representation of words. For example, in a machine translation task, word embeddings can be used to help the model understand the meaning of the words in the source language, which can lead to better translations.\n",
